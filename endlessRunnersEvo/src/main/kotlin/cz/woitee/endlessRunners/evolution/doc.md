# Package cz.woitee.endlessRunners.evolution

This package contains all the evolutionary computation done with this framework.

# Package cz.woitee.endlessRunners.evolution.alterers

Custom alterers (operators) that we use in the evolution.

# Package cz.woitee.endlessRunners.evolution.coevolution

Algorithms for running the coevolution of GameDescriptions, PlayerControllers and HeightBlocks.

# Package cz.woitee.endlessRunners.evolution.coevolution.evolved

Runnable results (GameDescriptions, PlayerControllers and HeightBlocks) from the coevolutionary attempts.

# Package cz.woitee.endlessRunners.evolution.evoBlock

Algorithms and other classes for running the evolution of HeightBlocks.

# Package cz.woitee.endlessRunners.evolution.evoController

Algorithms and other classes for running the evolution of PlayerControllers.

# Package cz.woitee.endlessRunners.evolution.evoController.evolved

Ready to use evolved PlayerControllers (neural networks).

# Package cz.woitee.endlessRunners.evolution.evoGame

Algorithms and other classes for running the evolution of GameDescriptions.

# Package cz.woitee.endlessRunners.evolution.evoGame.evolved

Ready to use evolved GameDescriptions.

# Package cz.woitee.endlessRunners.evolution.grandEvo

A package for running simultaneous evolution of more than one of {GameDescription, PlayerController and HeightBlock}
at the same time - by encoding them into a single genotype.

# Package cz.woitee.endlessRunners.evolution.utils

Utility classes for designing evolution, logging it, and others.
